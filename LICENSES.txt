As specified in the Terms of Use, which can be found in README.md,
all of my scripts can be used in non-commercial RPGMakerVXAce projects
without special permission.

Furthermore, my scripts cannot be used in commercial RPGMakerVXAce
projects without that special permission.

Since anyone could fake a permission, I decided to provide a public list of
these permissions. If you know of a commercial RMVXAce project that is
using any of my scripts and that is not listed below, please contact me
immediately in GitHub or on RMVXAce.net.

The following people are allowed to use certain scripts in commercial projects.
The Terms of Use specified in the latest version of README.md still apply.
